# Unhandled Null Check in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart related to null safety: forgetting to handle null values before using them.

The `bug.dart` file shows the code with the error.  The `bugSolution.dart` provides the corrected code.  This null-check omission can lead to runtime errors, so always ensure that nullable variables are appropriately checked.
